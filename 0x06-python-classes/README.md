Classes and Objects

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), classes, objects, instances, methods and attributes in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
