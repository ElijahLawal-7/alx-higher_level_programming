# Inheritance
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about inheritance, superclass, baseclass and subclass in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-lookup.py` | Function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object |
| `1-my_list.py` | Class `MyList` that inhertis from `list` |
| `2-is_same_class.py` | Function that returns `True` if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class; otherwise `False` |
| `3-is_kind_of_class.py` | Function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class |
| `4-inherits_from.py` | Function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from the specified class |
| `5-base_geometry.py` | Empty class `BaseGeometry` |
| `6-base_geometry.py` | Class `BaseGeometry` with public instance method `def area(self):` |
| `7-base_geometry.py` | Class `BaseGeometry` with public instance method that verifies if the input arg is an integer |
| `8-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that inhertis from `BaseGeometry` |
| `9-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that inhertis from `BaseGeometry`, with `area()` method implemented |
