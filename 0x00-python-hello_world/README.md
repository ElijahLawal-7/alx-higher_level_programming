# Hello, World
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Alx School**. It aims to learn about variables, basics commands (print) and handle strings with **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
